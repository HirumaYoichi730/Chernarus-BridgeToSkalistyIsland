DayZ Chernarus - BridgeToSkalistyIsland
I had this idea for a bridge to Skalisty Island.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 20x StaticObj_Bridge_Stone_25.
2: 5x Bonfire.
3: 4x Land_Castle_Donjon


So the bridge is located Southeast of Tulga at the coast. There is a bonfire on the ground at these cordinates: 12990 / 3811. If you type in
these cordinates on iZurvive you will see a ADA Wreck about 50 meters away from the bonfire.
The reason for the fifth bonfire that is on the ground is just for helping players to see the location for the bridge more easily.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/BridgeToSkalistyIsland.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/BridgeToSkalistyIsland.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
